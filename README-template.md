### What I learned

I focused on HTML structure, using css variables consistently for spacing and colours, and the refactor process once my intial build was complete.

### Continued development

I want to continue proactively choosing my HTML structure to keep it clean and coherent, I also want to introduce more interactive components to my future projects using JavaScript.
