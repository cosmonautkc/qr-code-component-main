## Overview

This is my solution to the QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to recreate the layout as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused on HTML structure, using css variables consistently for spacing and colours, and the refactor process once my intial build was complete.

### Continued development

I want to continue proactively choosing my HTML structure to keep it clean and coherent, I also want to introduce more interactive components to my future projects using JavaScript.
